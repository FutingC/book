# Introduction

## What is Scientific Computing?
By definition, computing to support science!  Scientific method (with some computational topics):

1. Ask a question (exploratory data analysis)
2. Formulate a hypothesis (use a model)
3. Design an experiment to test hypothesis (simulation)
4. Analyze data (fit a model, perform uncertainty quantification)

## Why Python?
Python has become an extremely popular language in academia and industry.  Chances are that you will use it at some point in the future no matter where you end up.

1. scripted language, easy to develop in
2. lots of great libraries
3. lots of community support

Languages that fill similar roles as Python for scientific computing: Matlab, R, Julia

If you're serious about scientific computing, I would recommend (at least) learning some C++ after this course, which is the language of choice for performance-critical code, and which is often wrapped by high-level languages (such as Python).  Unfortunately, we can't do everything in a single quarter.


## About this "Book"

This book organizes material into chapters that more or less contain information about a single topic.  This is done in an attempt to organize information in a sensible way.  However, it is not intended to be read or taught in the sequential order seen in the table of contents.  The course will carve some path through the content of the book, and any reader can likewise choose their own adventure through the content.

The chapters are as follows:

<ol start="0">
	<li>Python - syntax, basic packages, basic and advanced topics</li>
	<li> Analysis - asymptotics and convergence</li>
	<li> Linear algebra - dense and sparse</li>
	<li> Optimization - specifying and solving problems</li>
	<li> Functions - root finding, interpolation, calculus on computers</li>
	<li> Graphs - the network kind</li>
	<li> Probability and Statistics - generating random numbers, distributions, parameter estimation</li>
	<li> Data - reading data, visualization, machine learning</li>
	<li> Geometry - metrics, nearest neighbor search, clustering</li>
	<li> Computing - how to use computing resources, how to work with other people</li>
</ol>
